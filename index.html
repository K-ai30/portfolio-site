        <p> 
			I am passionate about art, especially drawing, painting, photography and design.  I have a Bachelor of Fine Art in Photography from Savannah College of Art and Design.  After working for 5 years, I went back to school for my masters while working full-time.  I currently hold a Master of Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing.  Outside of my interests in continued learning, I volunteer and work with a couple nonprofit organizations.
        </p>
        <p>     
			My favorite hobbies include working with digital platforms (Canva, Adobe Creative Suite, and Microsoft Office) and social media (Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram).  Through social media, content creation and website updates, I often assist the nonprofit with whom I volunteer and whose mission I value.  I collaborated with the nonprofit and a team of graphic designers and web developers to overhaul and update their website.
        </p>
        <p>
			I have helped others interested in building their brand by creating a website and social media presence.  This work led to my interest in coding and web development.
		</p>
		<p>
			Through the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp, I am working toward becoming a full stack web developer with the intent of focusing on front-end web development.  I want to become a web developer and learn skills that make me more competitive as a digital marketing professional.  In particular, I have enjoyed my exposure to coding languages and want to become more adept at understanding and using those languages, as it relates to web design and layout.
