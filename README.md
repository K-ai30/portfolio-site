Introduction to Web Development, HTML, CSS, and Git


This project was created to begin to understand how to use HTML, CSS, and Git for basic styling and manipulation.  The challenges with this project were to begin to conceptualize and put into practice how to code a simple website based off images of a template that included the following elements:

    Header
    Sticky Footer
    Floats
    Padding
    Navigation Bar
    Images
    Forms

The inclusion of these elements sets a foundation for which other sites and applications can be built.  However, using these elements meant familiarizing myself with other elements (i.e., id, padding, margins, sections, links, containers, positioning, classes, and divs) and other elements.

I enjoyed working on this project in order to understand the complexities of web design.  The template provides a good foray into simple, but elegant design and easy to use functionality.  I have a greater understanding of how I should structure my coding going forward to arrive at the best structure/framework of a website.

The project solves some issues surrounding best practices and/or naming conventions, as it became apparent that how elements are named can add to and confuse the effect on each "variable".  From reviewing the code of my peers and instructors, I realized they may have approached the coding from the most straightforward approach thereby reducing the amount of code needed to accomplish the task.

Features:

One of the "extra" features I included were enhanced elements on the Navigation Links to add styling to the buttons in the form of "On Hover" effects.
